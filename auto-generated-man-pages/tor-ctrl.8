.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBtor\-ctl\fR [\-switch] [variable]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBtor\-ctrl\fR is a commandline tool for executing commands on a tor server via the controlport\. In order to get this to work, add "ControlPort 9051" and "CookieAuthentication 1" to your torrc and reload tor\. Or \- if you want a fixed password \- leave out "CookieAuthentication 1" and use the following line to create the appropriate HashedControlPassword entry for your torrc (you need to change yourpassword, of course):
.P
\fBecho "HashedControlPassword $(tor \-\-hash\-password yourpassword | tail \-n 1)"\fR
.P
For setting the bandwidth for specific times of the day, I suggest calling tor\-ctrl via cron, e\.g\.:
.P
\fB0 22 * * * /path/to/tor\-ctrl \-c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=1mb"\fR
.P
\fB0 7 * * * /path/to/tor\-ctrl \-c "SETCONF bandwidthrate=100kb"\fR
.P
This would set the bandwidth to 100kb at 07:00 and to 1mb at 22:00\. You can use notations like 1mb, 1kb or the number of bytes\.
.P
Many, many other things are possible, see
